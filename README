# Socialbats

## Welcome to socialbats, the free social-network-icon fontset for the interwebs

These icon-fonts are made to have page conform and neutral social-website and social-bookmarking-icons as an @font-face solution for your and my website. I developed the icons in 2010 during my sparetime to use them among several web-applications. If you like them, use them.

### They are tested @work, Applications using embats are:

http://projectforge.org (the application, not the website)
http://enercast.de (the application, not the website)

### Have fun

Download the package, open the socialbats-webfontkit/socialbatsRegular-demo.html and have a look onto the fonts.

Use the @font-face fonts like everyone else.

Have a lot of fun!
